              Completing her mini residency at dai hall, Lee will present
              site-specific piece FERVĒRE, informed by walls and air in the space.
              FERVĒRE consists of manifold formats and elements including spoken
              voice, electronic music, live performance and textual score,
              addressing a particular entanglement of racism and sexism on Asian
              female bodies with reference to the real-life events of Atlanta Spa
              Shooting and the case of artist Theresa Hak Kyung Cha. Lee thematises
              homophonic translation and wild fermentation as metaphor for survival
              of trauma, ‘misheard voice’ and tells a story about a woman rising up
              to living again after a horrendous experience of violence. FERVĒRE
              examine ways of listening to languages and politics of inclusion,
              interrogating a diversity in languages through artistic context,
              encouraging audiences to reflect their own current cultural and
              political heritage. Supported by the Minority Ethnic Artists Programme
              by Arts Council Northern Ireland.

              Una Lee is an artist working with sounds, stories and sensations. She
              is in perpetual pursuit of found sound and ways for alternative
              storytelling. She sings, narrates, writes stories, collects field
              recordings and makes things. She also composes and designs her own
              live and/or fixed performances and intervention scenarios. Most of her
              works, whilst being primarily sound-based, incorporate
              interdisciplinary aspects such as performance art, visual art and
              theatre practice with interest in exploring time, memories,
              representations, human condition and ecology. She is native of South
              Korea and holds a MA and PhD in Sonic arts from Queen's University
              Belfast. She is a recipient of The Oram Awards 2020.

            Anne-F Jacques: Incomplete Cleaner (2022). Recycling an old washing
            machine was a starting point for Anne-F and her collaborator Ryoko Akama
            whose approach was to experiment on a sculptural work they had never
            done before. The idea of this installation is the reuse of found
            materials and reawakening of meanings of these objects which are placed
            for a temporary period of time in a new environment. In this, sound,
            vision and architectural experience is equally important alongside a
            joyous humour. Each micro kinetic movement that seems unnecessary is
            inevitable for others to become alive, which is how any ecosystem is
            operated in our world.
          </p>

            Anne-F Jacques is a sound artist based in Montreal, Canada, interested
            in amplification, erratic sound reproduction devices & construction of
            various contraptions and idiosyncratic systems. Her particular focus is
            on low technology, trivial objects and unpolished sounds.

            Bunchi: FM 97.6 - 98.9 MHz “A sound sculpture about finding a radio
            station that I used to listen to regularly. The signal stopped in
            between 97.6 - 98.9 MHz. This is a space time.”

            CHAN cho kiu Bunchi (b.1990, Hong Kong) graduated from the Academy of
            Visual Arts of the Hong Kong Baptist University and currently lives and
            works in Japan. Her strengths are getting lost, walking, collecting
            "natural objects" produced by humans, then revealing movement and
            dialogue under the surface to imagine the invisible thread of all
            things. She works primarily in painting and mix-media installation. Her
            exhibitions include "10 Years of ASP “ Soundpocket, Hong Kong (2021);
            “Sayonara Mark II” Toyota MarkII, Tokyo (2021); “Münster Sculpture
            Project in Sagamihara 2018” Kanuma Park, Tokyo (2018); and solo

            Muku Kobayashi: Nyuu Fyu A machine is in motion that seems to have some
            kind of function. Every time it is driven, it makes a noise, but the
            immediate sound has an unclear relationship to the purpose of the
            machine. The variations in movement are partly controlled and partly
            left to the behaviour of the objects. Each machine has the same shape
            and mechanism, but each seems to work stand-alone. On the other hand,
            their organic movements seem to have an ecosystem linked to each other.
            The machine's shape, colour and movement seem designed, though. Just as
            product design is designed with a clear intention for a certain matter,
            design must have a purpose. On the other hand, these machines continue
            to operate with their purpose suspended in the air.

            Muku Kobayashi Born in Tokyo in 1992. Currently based in Kyoto, Japan.
            Completed Tama Art University’s Graduate Program in Information Design
            in 2017, and the Master’s course in the Department of Sculpture at the
            Graduate School of Arts, Kyoto City University of Arts in 2019. He
            creates works by observing the manifestation and deterioration of the
            characteristics of things when they are inserted into a certain
            organization or institution, or when they become complicit in the
            operation of such entities.

            Yonago Tadashi: Things which make a sound sounded. Even if there was no
            any things which can listen it. Before we have appeared, and after we
            have disappeared even.
