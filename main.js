This warm feeling of familiarity irritates you. We have to look for a new balance. Build some opposite worlds, make your teeth rattle, snap your fingers, each impact is a clue about the birth of the next gesture. Organise them. Each impact is a punch and now you need to strike hard. Paint the surfaces with a scream, no matter what its quality, it will fragment into echoes and will dissolve. Breath hard and blow but don’t stop walking. The skin behind your heels becomes hard and your feet are swollen, the pain is not negotiable, it is resonating.” </p>",

The kkwaenggwari provides rhythmical ritual flow created by feedback system equipped hidden, and takes over the gesture from the bamboos, expanding its rhythmic worlds outwards, until the whole space becomes a part of the resonating body, singing and breathing together with the instruments’ stubborn struggling voices.</p>",

His use of various every-day objects (tubes, plastic bowls, balloons, aluminium foil…) to “prepare” the trumpet, and his unique playing techniques allow him to create raw soundscapes that sound sometimes like electronics (he himself describes his playing as “electronic music, played acoustically”), especially when he plays several continuous layers of sound at the same time on an instrument that is not designed for that.</p>",
