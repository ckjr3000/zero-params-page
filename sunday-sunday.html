        <h2>OPENING LIVE PERFORMANCE : Sunday 10th July</h2>
        <h3>FERVĒRE (2022) by Una Lee</h3>
        <image src="#"></image>
        <p>
          Completing her mini residency at dai hall, Lee will present
          site-specific piece FERVĒRE, informed by walls and air in the space.
          FERVĒRE consists of manifold formats and elements including spoken
          voice, electronic music, live performance and textual score,
          addressing a particular entanglement of racism and sexism on Asian
          female bodies with reference to the real-life events of Atlanta Spa
          Shooting and the case of artist Theresa Hak Kyung Cha. Lee thematises
          homophonic translation and wild fermentation as metaphor for survival
          of trauma, ‘misheard voice’ and tells a story about a woman rising up
          to living again after a horrendous experience of violence. FERVĒRE
          examine ways of listening to languages and politics of inclusion,
          interrogating a diversity in languages through artistic context,
          encouraging audiences to reflect their own current cultural and
          political heritage. Supported by the Minority Ethnic Artists Programme
          by Arts Council Northern Ireland.

          Una Lee is an artist working with sounds, stories and sensations. She
          is in perpetual pursuit of found sound and ways for alternative
          storytelling. She sings, narrates, writes stories, collects field
          recordings and makes things. She also composes and designs her own
          live and/or fixed performances and intervention scenarios. Most of her
          works, whilst being primarily sound-based, incorporate
          interdisciplinary aspects such as performance art, visual art and
          theatre practice with interest in exploring time, memories,
          representations, human condition and ecology. She is native of South
          Korea and holds a MA and PhD in Sonic arts from Queen's University
          Belfast. She is a recipient of The Oram Awards 2020.

        Anne-F Jacques: Incomplete Cleaner (2022). Recycling an old washing
        machine was a starting point for Anne-F and her collaborator Ryoko Akama
        whose approach was to experiment on a sculptural work they had never
        done before. The idea of this installation is the reuse of found
        materials and reawakening of meanings of these objects which are placed
        for a temporary period of time in a new environment. In this, sound,
        vision and architectural experience is equally important alongside a
        joyous humour. Each micro kinetic movement that seems unnecessary is
        inevitable for others to become alive, which is how any ecosystem is
        operated in our world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anne-F Jacques is a sound artist based in Montreal, Canada, interested
        in amplification, erratic sound reproduction devices & construction of
        various contraptions and idiosyncratic systems. Her particular focus is
        on low technology, trivial objects and unpolished sounds.

        Bunchi: FM 97.6 - 98.9 MHz “A sound sculpture about finding a radio
        station that I used to listen to regularly. The signal stopped in
        between 97.6 - 98.9 MHz. This is a space time.”
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAN cho kiu Bunchi (b.1990, Hong Kong) graduated from the Academy of
        Visual Arts of the Hong Kong Baptist University and currently lives and
        works in Japan. Her strengths are getting lost, walking, collecting
        "natural objects" produced by humans, then revealing movement and
        dialogue under the surface to imagine the invisible thread of all
        things. She works primarily in painting and mix-media installation. Her
        exhibitions include "10 Years of ASP “ Soundpocket, Hong Kong (2021);
        “Sayonara Mark II” Toyota MarkII, Tokyo (2021); “Münster Sculpture
        Project in Sagamihara 2018” Kanuma Park, Tokyo (2018); and solo
        exhibition "Housewife Math” The Steak House Doskoi @ XYZ collective,
        Tokyo (2022); “Object Conference” Art Center Ongoing, Tokyo (2017).

        Muku Kobayashi: Nyuu Fyu A machine is in motion that seems to have some
        kind of function. Every time it is driven, it makes a noise, but the
        immediate sound has an unclear relationship to the purpose of the
        machine. The variations in movement are partly controlled and partly
        left to the behaviour of the objects. Each machine has the same shape
        and mechanism, but each seems to work stand-alone. On the other hand,
        their organic movements seem to have an ecosystem linked to each other.
        The machine's shape, colour and movement seem designed, though. Just as
        product design is designed with a clear intention for a certain matter,
        design must have a purpose. On the other hand, these machines continue
        to operate with their purpose suspended in the air.

      <p>
        Muku Kobayashi Born in Tokyo in 1992. Currently based in Kyoto, Japan.
        Completed Tama Art University’s Graduate Program in Information Design
        in 2017, and the Master’s course in the Department of Sculpture at the
        Graduate School of Arts, Kyoto City University of Arts in 2019. He
        creates works by observing the manifestation and deterioration of the
        characteristics of things when they are inserted into a certain
        organization or institution, or when they become complicit in the
        operation of such entities.

        Yonago Tadashi: Things which make a sound Sounded. Even if there was no
        any things which can listen it. Before we have appeared, and after we
        have disappeared even.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yonago Tadashi is a trombone player, improviser, composer, engineer and
        maker of sound objects and instruments. He was a member of electronic
        ensembles SjQ and SjQ++. The latter received an Award of Distinction at
        Ars electronica 2013, in the Digital Musics and Sound Art section. Born
        in Japan, 1980.
