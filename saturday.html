              After her family attempts to sell her into marriage, a young Afghan
              refugee in Iran channels her frustrations and seizes her destiny
              through music. Grabbing the mic, she spits fiery rhymes in the face
              of oppressive traditions.<br>

              Ji Youn Kang plays with two customized bamboos and a kkwaenggwari,
              with analog devices that connect the instruments for further
              real-time processing. She uses the voltage flow between her body, a
              self-built generator, the bamboo sticks and an extra synth, until
              they become strongly linked together. The kkwaenggwari provides
              rhythmical ritual flow created by feedback system equipped hidden,
              and takes over the gesture from the bamboos, expanding its rhythmic
              worlds outwards, until the whole space becomes a part of the
              resonating body, singing and breathing together with the
              instruments’ stubborn struggling voices.

              Ji Youn Kang is a Korean composer, performer and sound artist based
              in The Hague. Most of her music pieces have been composed based on
              the rites of Korean Shamanism, and many of them were written for
              Wave Field Synthesis System, exploring the relationship between
              musical and physical spaces. She is also active as a solo performer
              seeking for the ways to combine three different sound areas on
              stage; acoustic instruments, analog and digital sound with DIY
              analog synthesizers and live processing on laptop. Currently she is
              teaching at the Institute of Sonology in Koninklijk Conservatorium.<br>

              Playing in solo has always been an important part of Mazen Kerbaj’s
              musical journey; it is in this bare-bones setup that he can
              experiment the most with his instrument, pushing it beyond any
              recognition. His use of various every-day objects (tubes, plastic
              bowls, balloons, aluminium foil…) to “prepare” the trumpet, and his
              unique playing techniques allow him to create raw soundscapes that
              sound sometimes like electronics (he himself describes his playing
              as “electronic music, played acoustically”), especially when he
              plays several continuous layers of sound at the same time on an
              instrument that is not designed for that.
