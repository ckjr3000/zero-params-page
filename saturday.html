            After her family attempts to sell her into marriage, a young Afghan
            refugee in Iran channels her frustrations and seizes her destiny
            through music. Grabbing the mic, she spits fiery rhymes in the face
            of oppressive traditions.

            The couple behind shared projects including The Hunter Gracchus and
            Singing Knives Records and individual projects such as Roman Nose,
            Blue Yodel and Papal Bull, Fiona Kennedy and Jon Marshall’s duo work
            draws on their professional and personal experiences of mental
            health as manifested in the individual and the family and set
            against contemporary depoliticised, pathologizing and commodified
            interventions, playing with disrupted sound localization and
            attempts to determine and categorise acousmatic and visualised sound
            sources.

          <p>
            Ji Youn Kang plays with two customized bamboos and a kkwaenggwari,
            with analog devices that connect the instruments for further
            real-time processing. She uses the voltage flow between her body, a
            self-built generator, the bamboo sticks and an extra synth, until
            they become strongly linked together. The kkwaenggwari provides
            rhythmical ritual flow created by feedback system equipped hidden,
            and takes over the gesture from the bamboos, expanding its rhythmic
            worlds outwards, until the whole space becomes a part of the
            resonating body, singing and breathing together with the
            instruments’ stubborn struggling voices.

          <p>
            Ji Youn Kang is a Korean composer, performer and sound artist based
            in The Hague. Most of her music pieces have been composed based on
            the rites of Korean Shamanism, and many of them were written for
            Wave Field Synthesis System, exploring the relationship between
            musical and physical spaces. She is also active as a solo performer
            seeking for the ways to combine three different sound areas on
            stage; acoustic instruments, analog and digital sound with DIY
            analog synthesizers and live processing on laptop. Currently she is
            teaching at the Institute of Sonology in Koninklijk Conservatorium.

          <p>
            Playing in solo has always been an important part of Mazen Kerbaj’s
            musical journey; it is in this bare-bones setup that he can
            experiment the most with his instrument, pushing it beyond any
            recognition. His use of various every-day objects (tubes, plastic
            bowls, balloons, aluminium foil…) to “prepare” the trumpet, and his
            unique playing techniques allow him to create raw soundscapes that
            sound sometimes like electronics (he himself describes his playing
            as “electronic music, played acoustically”), especially when he
            plays several continuous layers of sound at the same time on an
            instrument that is not designed for that.
