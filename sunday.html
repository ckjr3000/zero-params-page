            NeAnoNeNoNo is a new publication concern, and this performance will
            celebrate a new issue of the zine with that name. Most of the
            characters you will meet in this performance have work in this
            ‘paginated exhibition’, and maybe someday they all will, maybe all
            of you will too. NeAnoNeNoNo celebrates indecisiveness, prods the
            clouds for surprise, seeds snowbanks and sandbanks, and deposits
            crystal treasures to be covered over by barchan dunes, petrified or
            melted to reveal the imagined colour, newly discovered, or carried
            forward. For our purposes, the difference between a shaky or out of
            focus photograph and photograph of clouds close-up is equivocal,
            useful. In this performance, we have assembled a group of people to
            do things: We will show you, with/out telling you, or each other,
            what it is we are doing, in the manner the modern, morden ballet of
            birds both avian and waterfowl. Whether we know it or not, we use
            diverse languages to do this: singing, dancing bat-acrobat,
            telepathic-telephonic, southern, synthetic, syntagmatic,
            spiderwebbed, semiotic, funk, musical, form, from the spots on the
            neck of giraffe, otherwise animalian (i.e. whale), substitute,
            computational, prehistoric, accidental, stegnographic, footprints on
            staff lines indicating the need to go outside, get somewhere, to
            remain. Everyday life is suspended between us: we float. Sous les
            pavés, la plage.

            Chase's music-making teeters on the precipice of the spontaneous

            whirl of acoustical phenomena [~WOBBLE~], plummeting to a mesh of

            ‘Gritstone’ combines John's new found passion for rock climbing and
            his popular audio software Forester. The performance focuses on the
            material qualities of Gritstone, which was quarried in the Peaks for
            use in milling flour and grinding blades. The gritstone edges of the
            Peaks are now a much loved climbing areas. During the performance
            John will create sounds using pieces of gritstone as well as using
            field recordings he has made across the Peak District.
