              NeAnoNeNoNo is a new publication concern, and this performance
              will celebrate a new issue of the zine with that name. Most of the
              characters you will meet in this performance have work in this
              ‘paginated exhibition’, and maybe someday they all will, maybe all
              of you will too.<br> NeAnoNeNoNo celebrates indecisiveness, prods the
              clouds for surprise, seeds snowbanks and sandbanks, and deposits
              crystal treasures to be covered over by barchan dunes, petrified
              or melted to reveal the imagined colour, newly discovered, or
              carried forward.<br> For our purposes, the difference between a shaky
              or out of focus photograph and photograph of clouds close-up is
              equivocal, useful.<br> In this performance, we have assembled a group
              of people to do things: We will show you, with/out telling you, or
              each other, what it is we are doing, in the manner the modern,
              morden ballet of birds both avian and waterfowl. Whether we know
              it or not, we use diverse languages to do this: singing, dancing
              bat-acrobat, telepathic-telephonic, southern, synthetic,
              syntagmatic, spiderwebbed, semiotic, funk, musical, form, from the

              footprints on staff lines indicating the need to go outside, get
              somewhere, to remain.<br> Everyday life is suspended between us: we

              Chase's music-making teeters on the precipice of the spontaneous
              [Whoaa, now], quivering gracelessly on an unthreading wire of
              compositional conceits [TWANG! THWACK!], flailing limbs akimbo in
              a whirl of acoustical phenomena [~WOBBLE~], plummeting to a mesh
              of performer cooperation [aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa], bouncing anvil-like
              to a dusty floor of participatory scores [kmnpff...].

              ‘Gritstone’ combines John's new found passion for rock climbing
              and his popular audio software Forester. The performance focuses
              on the material qualities of Gritstone, which was quarried in the
              Peaks for use in milling flour and grinding blades. The gritstone
              edges of the Peaks are now a much loved climbing areas. During the
              performance John will create sounds using pieces of gritstone as
              well as using field recordings he has made across the Peak
              District.
