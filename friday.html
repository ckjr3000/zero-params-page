              Since childhood, Adam has been invariably fascinated by the details
              and nuances of the most prosaic everyday things. The more
              expendable, pedestrian and disregarded the better. Anything that
              hints at a new purpose is slipped into his dependable shopping bag,
              and joins the throng of objects spilling out of every available
              space in his cosy cluttered flat in Catford. Continually Adam
              records a narrative on daily life upon his trusty cassette tape
              dictaphone, his singular observations and descriptions paint a rich
              picture of what appeals to him most. As the real life inspiration
              for Gilderoy, the central character in Peter Strickland’s Berberian
              Sound Studio, Adam is an under-recognized and particular sort of
              national treasure. Spend a day in his company, as he genially guides
              us through his habitual combing of the streets and charity shops of
              Catford, concocts collages at his kitchen table, and finds drama in
              the signage of Lewisham hospital. Eavesdrop on his multitudinous
              reflections upon his creative predilections, and become wonderfully
              enmeshed in the richly woven web of his creative processes.
              “Scavenger improv artisan, junk mail poet and scrapbook illustrator
              – Cathy Soreny’s documentary on Adam Bohman is an essential portrait
              of one of Britain’s most idiosyncratic and quietly prolific
              artists.” - Peter Strickland, Director After the film screening
              there will be a short Q+A with the film’s director Cathy Soreny +

              LÀ OÙ L’AIR FROTTE “Soon, the world will become a big sound box and
              your legs will be two heavy mallets. This cadence that made us feel
              comfortable now appears as an old story. This warm feeling of
              familiarity irritates you. We have to look for a new balance. Build
              some opposite worlds, make your teeth rattle, snap your fingers,
              each impact is a clue about the birth of the next gesture. Organise
              them. Each impact is a punch and now you need to strike hard. Paint
              the surfaces with a scream, no matter what its quality, it will
              fragment into echoes and will dissolve. Breath hard and blow but
              don’t stop walking. The skin behind your heels becomes hard and your
              feet are swollen, the pain is not negotiable, it is resonating.”

              Arthur Chambry is a multidisciplinary artist and musician based in
              Brussels. He makes work by weaving performance, music,
              instrument-making and narration. Arthur is continuously searching
              for new spaces and new instruments to create performances in which
              he uses his body in bombastic musical gestures. You can find him,
              alone or accompanied by performers, in an abandoned chapel, in a
              theater or in a long resonating tunnel somewhere in the city. You'll
              hear drones and percussions, you'll listen to tales, you'll see
              lungs-balls, long flowers-clarinets and you'll feel long breaths.

              Adam Bohman and Jonathan Bohman have been recording together since
              their early teens and playing live since 1984. Their repertoire
              includes a combination of sounds created in the moment and distinct
              compositions including songs. They use unconventional instruments,
              household objects, dislocated text from found, literary and
              commercial sources and collaged layers of recordings. They have
              performed at Tate Britain, Tate Modern, Roundhouse, Royal Albert
              Hall, South Bank and numerous smaller venues around the UK. Also
              across Europe and America. Their duo recordings include 'A Twist For
              All Pockets' (Rossbin, 2001), 'Purely Practical' (Peripheral
              Conserve, 2002), ‘Back On The Streets' (Peripheral Conserve, 2012),
              ‘Library Music’ (Des Astres D’Or, 2019) and ‘In Their 70s’ (Fort

                Audrey Chen, Elaine Mitchener and Mariam Rezaei will be performing a
                free improv set as a trio.
              </p>
              <p>
                Elaine Mitchener is a vocalist working between free-improvisation,
                experimental and contemporary new music.
              </p>
              <p>
                Audrey Chen has been developing her solo and collaborative practices
                for the past 20 years, joining together the extended and inherent
                vocabularies of the un-processed voice, cello and analog
                electronics. Since the last 5 years, she has shifted back towards
                the exploration of the voice as a primary instrument, delving deeply
                into her own version of narrative and non-linear storytelling.
                Through extreme and unprocessed hyperextensions of her voice, she
                invokes a kind of joint resonant body/space in tandem with a
                Ciat-Lonbarde Fourses synth. American born but currently based in
                Berlin, she has performed widely across Europe, North/South Americas
                and Asia.

              <p> Mariam Rezaei grew up in Gateshead, England, playing the classical
                piano. She first developed an interest in DJing at the age of
                fifteen and began writing music at this time. Her interest in
                writing with turntables developed a little while later, as she was
                competing in local and national DJ competitions.</p>
